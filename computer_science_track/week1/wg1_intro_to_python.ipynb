Please know that if you decide to use Python in your project, you'll probably need a little more than this....... but it's a start. For any programming language it's a fact that Google'll be your best friend! So use that friend (a lot).\n",

Simply press 'run' on the top or use 'ctrl' + 'enter' to run a cell when your cursor is in it. Any code that's inside that cell will then be run. Do not fear if you get an error, read it and 9/10 times you'll be able to solve it from there. If not, ask google or one of the teachers for help :).\n",
